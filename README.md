## System Architecture

The system comprises the following components:

- **Central Coordinator Agent**: Acts as the command center, managing communications and orchestrating defense strategies among device agents.
- **Device Agents**: Represent individual network devices (e.g., routers, laptops, smartphones). Each agent monitors its device's status, detects anomalies, and reports potential threats to the Central Coordinator.
- **Communication Protocol**: Defines the interaction mechanisms between agents, ensuring timely and secure information exchange.

## Features

- **Threat Detection**: Device agents continuously monitor their respective devices, identifying suspicious activities and potential security breaches.
- **Collaborative Defense**: Upon detecting a threat, device agents communicate with the Central Coordinator to implement coordinated mitigation strategies.
- **Dynamic Security Policies**: The system adapts its defense mechanisms based on real-time threat intelligence, ensuring optimal protection.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate various network sizes, from small local networks to extensive enterprise infrastructures.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: [PADE (Platform for Agents Development and Execution)](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gundasanjana08/Multi-Agent-Cyber-Defense-System.git
   cd Multi-Agent-Cyber-Defense-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify any necessary environment variables as per your setup.

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the application in development mode. Access it via `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Usage Instructions

- **Monitoring**:
  - Access the dashboard to view real-time statuses of all device agents.
  - Monitor threat alerts and system logs for detailed insights.

- **Simulating Threats**:
  - Use the built-in simulation tools to introduce various threat scenarios and observe the system's response.

- **Adjusting Security Policies**:
  - Navigate to the settings panel to modify security parameters and policies as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Machine Learning**:
  - Implement anomaly detection algorithms to enhance threat identification accuracy.

- **Advanced Visualization**:
  - Develop comprehensive dashboards with graphical representations of network statuses and threat analytics.

- **Real-World Deployment**:
  - Adapt the system for deployment in actual network environments, ensuring compatibility with diverse hardware and software configurations.
